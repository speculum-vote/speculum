"""The source checker: the gate between AI research and the public site.

Every claim in the Dependents (an outcome, a context item, the record of a sale, an organization's stated
position) has a fingerprint of its content. Each night this module checks every claim that has no result
for its current fingerprint, and every claim a reader has disputed:

  1. it reads the claim's cited sources (fetching them itself, or letting the model fetch them),
  2. it asks Claude, as a strict fact-checker with no stake in the research, whether the sources say what
     the claim says and whether the evidence grade fits the definitions,
  3. for a dispute, it also reads the reader's source and decides whether the claim still stands.

Results go to data/chains/checks.json, keyed by fingerprint. Only "supported" claims are published, so a
failed fetch, an unclear answer or a missing key always leaves a claim off the site, never on it.

SYSTEM = f"""You are the source checker for Speculum, a nonpartisan public record of the US Congress. You did not
write the research you are checking and you have no stake in it. Your only job is to decide whether the cited
sources say what the claim says. You are strict: a claim that adds a figure, a date, an attribution, a
causal link or a degree of certainty that the source does not state is not supported, even if it is
probably true. Quoted words must appear in the source. Paraphrase must not change meaning or strength.
Counterpoints and scope notes attached to a claim are part of it and must also be supported (by the cited
source or by a source named inside them). Do not use your own knowledge to fill gaps. A claim may carry
"quote", the passage its writer relied on, and "locator", where it is: the quote must appear in the source
(allowing for spacing and line breaks), and the claim must not go beyond it. A "record field" claim is one
field of a decision's record ("record_of" names the decision); judge only that field's text.

Evidence grades, for outcome claims:
{GRADES}
