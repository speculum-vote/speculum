"""Lobbying spending by issue area, from quarterly LD-2 reports (lda.gov).

Every registrant files an LD-2 each quarter for each client: what it was paid (a lobbying firm reports
"income") or what it spent (an organization lobbying for itself reports "expenses"), and the general
issue areas it lobbied on. This module totals those reports per quarter.

Counting rules (published on the Method page):
- Amendments replace the report they amend: the latest posted report per registrant, client and quarter.
- Only quarterly reports count; registrations (RR, RA) carry no amounts and are skipped.
- No double counting: an organization's own report includes what it paid outside lobbying firms (LDA
  guidance), so when a client files for itself, the firms' reports for that client are not added. The
  LDA gives each firm its own client record, so the match is made on the organization's name, with
  punctuation and endings such as Inc. or LLC set aside.
- A report lists issue areas but not dollars per area, so its amount is split equally across the areas
  it lists.
