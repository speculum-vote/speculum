"""Consequence chains: the Interpreter's output.

A chain follows one decision forward:

    decision   a recorded vote, found by a fixed rule (never picked by topic or party)
    mechanism  what the decision actually changed (what was sold, to whom, by which contractors)
    outcome    what happened to people afterwards, from public datasets and investigations
    money      the funding present around the decision, from FEC and LD-203 filings

Every outcome link carries an evidence grade (documented, estimated, associated) and a source.
Decision and money links are computed from filings each night. Mechanism and outcome links are
drafted (by the AI drafter or by research) and stay marked as drafts until a reviewer approves them
in data/chains/reviews.json. A chain judges a decision; it never calls a person good or evil.
