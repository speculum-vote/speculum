"""Who lobbied each bill: the organizations naming it on their lobbying reports, by sector, the lobbyists who
list a former government post, the roll calls on it, and the money those organizations gave the members who
voted each way.

Rules (published on the Method page):
- A bill is "lobbied" by an organization when a quarterly lobbying report (LD-2) for that organization names
  the bill in its description of the lobbying. Reports do not say whether the organization was for or against.
- Organizations are counted once per bill, by name, across all quarters; sectors come from speculum/lobbysectors.
- Money: federal campaign contributions (LD-203) from organizations that lobbied the bill and file their own
  lobbying reports (so their registrant is the organization itself), to the members who voted yea or nay on each
  roll call. Every contribution reported since 2025 counts, whether before or after the vote. Contributions by
  lobbying firms are not counted here, since a firm works for many clients.
